# first portfolio ever
//  https://cyberman010.github.io/Portfolio/
# In this Website I learned plenty of things , I used JavaScript for the navbar, HTML & CSS and a little bit of Bootstrap to design the page , and make it more lookable 

# It took me 3 hours 11 minutes for Coding only , therefore it took me around 1 hr for choosing the colour , images and so on.

**It was really funny and challenging to maintain it , but it was great to work on a Portfolio and learn new things.**
